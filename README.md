# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

# GENERATE ABI

```
npx hardhat compile
```

# TESTING SMART CONTRACTS

```
npx hardhat test
```

# DEPLOY SMART CONTRACTS

```
npx hardhat run --network [network-name] filepath
```
# remix-contract-copy
